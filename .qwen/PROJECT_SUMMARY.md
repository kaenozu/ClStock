# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create and maintain a high-accuracy (84.6%, with breakthroughs toward 87%) AI stock price prediction and investment recommendation system called ClStock, with comprehensive documentation, robust architecture, and automated systems.

## Key Knowledge
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Architecture**: FastAPI (REST API), CLI interface (Click), modular model/data layers
- **Core Files**:
  - `models/precision/precision_87_system.py`: 87% precision breakthrough system (meta-learning + DQN + ensemble)
  - `analysis/sentiment_analyzer.py`: News sentiment integration
  - `systems/auto_retraining_system.py`: Automated model retraining
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: System architecture documentation (recently created)
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI, pandas, scikit-learn, yfinance (for data), plotly/dash (for dashboards), psutil (for monitoring)
- **Configuration**: Managed via `config/settings.py` with `dataclass` configuration
- **Security**: API token authentication, input validation, process security checks
- **Testing**: pytest-based test suite covering unit, integration, and functional tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (code quality workflow)

## Recent Actions
- **Created `ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Documented system layers (API, Model, Data, CLI, System components), core models, and 87% precision architecture
- **Successfully merged multiple PRs** bringing in various features and fixes:
  - Risk management system enhancements
  - Library version compatibility fixes (removing SciPy dependency via lightweight ML stubs)
  - Portfolio allocation validation
  - Company name field restoration in API responses
- **Resolved merge conflicts**: Handled conflicts in `prediction_dashboard.py` and `test_custom_deep_model.py` between PR #216 and main branch
- **Established comprehensive documentation**: The new `ARCHITECTURE.md` provides detailed system overview and component breakdown

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting system components and 87% precision system
- [DONE] Merge all outstanding pull requests including risk management, library fixes, and SciPy dependency removal
- [TODO] Address any remaining GitHub issues
- [TODO] Continue development on new features and improvements as per enhancement plans
- [TODO] Maintain and improve automated testing coverage
- [TODO] Implement monitoring and observability features as outlined in enhancement plan
