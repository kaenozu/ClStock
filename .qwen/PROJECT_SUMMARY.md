# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Resolve CI failures in PR #212 ("Fix library version compatibility issues") by ensuring consistent dependency versions and fixing import/type errors in `models/performance.py` and associated tests.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses `pip-tools` (`pip-compile`) for managing `requirements.txt`.
- `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and `shap` were causing CI build errors and have been removed from `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt`.
- Tests in `tests/unit/test_models/test_performance.py` rely on mocking `EnsembleStockPredictor` and `PredictionResult`.
- The local development environment uses Python 3.12.
- CI uses Ubuntu and Python 3.12.
- The project uses `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting.
- PR #212 aims to make the project compatible with newer library versions.

## Recent Actions
- Identified that CI failures were due to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy.sparse'; 'scipy' is not a package`.
- Removed `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and `shap` dependencies from `requirements.in` and regenerated `requirements.txt`.
- Modified `code-quality.yml` to disable `pip` caching to avoid issues with `scipy` installation.
- Addressed merge conflicts in `models/advanced/prediction_dashboard.py`.
- Fixed import issues in `tests/unit/test_models/test_performance.py` related to `PredictionResult` instantiation.
- Ensured `PredictionResult` is imported from `models.core` in `models/performance.py`.
- Ran `black` formatting on `models/performance.py` and `tests/unit/test_models/test_performance.py`.

## Current Plan
1.  [IN PROGRESS] Monitor latest CI run (`18298881645`) to confirm if dependency removal and code adjustments resolve the `scipy.sparse` import error.
2.  [TODO] If CI still fails, investigate deeper into why `scipy.sparse` is not found even after dependency removal, potentially related to other indirect dependencies or environment setup.
3.  [TODO] Once CI passes, review if removing `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, and `shap` has unintended side effects on functionality and consider alternative solutions if necessary.
4.  [TODO] Finalize PR #212 for merging after CI is green.
