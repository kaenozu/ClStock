## Issue Assignment: Hybrid Predictor bugs
- GitHub issue #9 reports two critical bugs: GPU batch predictions returning random data (models_new/hybrid/multi_gpu_processor.py) and real-time learning feedback using predicted values as ground truth (models_new/hybrid/hybrid_predictor.py).
- Assistant has taken ownership of diagnosing these issues and will work on implementation fixes next.
