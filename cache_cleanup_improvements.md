# Cache Cleanup Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to address automatic cache cleanup issues in the ClStock system.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Manual Cache Cleanup**: Previously, cache cleanup required manual intervention, potentially leading to disk space issues over time.
2. **Improper Thread Shutdown**: Cleanup threads were not properly terminated during system shutdown.
3. **Inflexible Configuration**: Cache cleanup intervals and sizes were hardcoded.
4. **Incomplete Size-Based Cleanup**: Size-based cleanup didn't return meaningful metrics.

## Files Modified

### 1. `models_new/hybrid/intelligent_cache.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added configurable cleanup interval and max cache size parameters to `__init__`
- Enhanced `shutdown()` method to properly wait for thread termination with timeout
- Improved `_cleanup_by_size_limit()` to return the number of removed entries
- Enhanced `_cleanup_memory_cache()` to return the number of removed entries
- Added detailed logging for initialization with configuration parameters

### 2. `models_new/monitoring/cache_manager.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added configurable cleanup interval parameter to `AdvancedCacheManager.__init__`
- Enhanced `shutdown()` method to properly wait for thread termination with timeout
- Improved `cleanup_old_cache()` to provide detailed logging of cleanup operations
- Enhanced `_remove_expired_entries()` to return the number of removed entries
- Enhanced `_apply_lru_cleanup()` to return the number of removed entries
- Added configurable cleanup interval parameter to `RealTimeCacheManager.__init__`
- Updated `RealTimeCacheManager.shutdown()` to provide appropriate logging
- Enhanced `cleanup_real_time_cache()` to return the number of removed entries

### 3. `utils/cache.py`

**Changes Made:**
- Added automatic cleanup functionality with configurable interval to `DataCache`
- Implemented proper thread management with shutdown event
- Added `shutdown()` method to gracefully terminate cleanup threads
- Updated global cache instance to enable automatic cleanup with 30-minute intervals
- Added `shutdown_cache()` function to properly terminate the global cache

## Key Improvements

### 1. Automatic Cleanup Threads
All cache managers now have automatic cleanup threads that:
- Run at configurable intervals
- Gracefully terminate on system shutdown
- Provide detailed logging of cleanup operations

### 2. Configurable Parameters
Cache managers now accept configuration parameters for:
- Cleanup intervals (in seconds)
- Maximum cache sizes
- TTL values

### 3. Proper Thread Management
Shutdown methods now:
- Signal cleanup threads to terminate
- Wait for thread completion with timeout
- Log warnings if threads don't terminate gracefully

### 4. Enhanced Cleanup Metrics
Cleanup methods now:
- Return the number of removed entries
- Provide detailed logging of cleanup operations
- Distinguish between different types of cleanup (expiration vs. LRU)

## Configuration Examples

```python
# Intelligent Prediction Cache with custom settings
cache = IntelligentPredictionCache(
    cleanup_interval=600,  # 10 minutes
    max_cache_size=500
)

# Advanced Cache Manager with custom settings
cache_manager = AdvancedCacheManager(
    max_cache_size=2000,
    ttl_hours=12,
    cleanup_interval=900  # 15 minutes
)

# Real-time Cache Manager with custom settings
rt_cache_manager = RealTimeCacheManager(
    max_cache_size=10000,
    ttl_hours=1,
    cleanup_interval=300  # 5 minutes
)
```

## Usage

To properly shut down cache managers and ensure cleanup threads terminate gracefully:

```python
# For Intelligent Prediction Cache
intelligent_cache.shutdown()

# For Advanced Cache Manager
advanced_cache.shutdown()

# For global cache
from utils.cache import shutdown_cache
shutdown_cache()
```

These improvements ensure that cache resources are automatically managed and properly cleaned up, preventing disk space issues and memory bloat over time.
