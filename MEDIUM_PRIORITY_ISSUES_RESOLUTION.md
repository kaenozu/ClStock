# Medium Priority Issues Resolution Report

## 1. Logging Inconsistencies Resolved

### Problem
Different modules used different logging approaches:
- Some used `logging.getLogger(__name__)` directly
- Others used `setup_logger(__name__)` from utils.logger_config
- Some used `get_logger(__name__)` from utils.logger_config

### Solution
Standardized all logging to use `setup_logger(__name__)` from the centralized logger configuration:

**Files Modified:**
- `data/real_time_provider.py` - Changed from `logging.getLogger(__name__)` to `setup_logger(__name__)`
- `data/real_time_factory.py` - Changed from `logging.getLogger(__name__)` to `setup_logger(__name__)`
- `models/advanced.py` - Changed from `logging.getLogger(__name__)` to `setup_logger(__name__)`

This ensures consistent logging behavior across all modules and prevents multiple logger initialization issues.

## 2. Configuration Management Improved

### Problem
Some modules accessed environment variables directly rather than through the configuration system.

### Solution
Verified that environment variable access is properly centralized in `config/settings.py`. The only direct environment variable access is in this centralized location where it should be.

**Files Verified:**
- `config/settings.py` - Contains all environment variable loading via `os.getenv()`
- `systems/process_manager.py` - Uses `os.environ.copy()` legitimately for subprocess environment setup

No changes were needed as the configuration access was already properly centralized.

## 3. Test Coverage Gaps Addressed

### Problem
Several critical components lacked comprehensive unit tests.

### Solution
Created comprehensive unit tests for critical components:

**New Test Files Created:**

1. **Configuration System Tests** (`tests_new/unit/test_config/`)
   - `test_settings.py` - Tests for settings loading and environment variable integration
   - `test_config_dataclasses.py` - Tests for all configuration dataclasses
   - `conftest.py` - Test configuration fixtures
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

2. **Process Manager Tests** (`tests_new/unit/test_systems/`)
   - `test_process_manager.py` - Comprehensive tests for process management functionality
   - `conftest.py` - Test configuration fixtures
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

3. **Logger Configuration Tests** (`tests_new/unit/test_utils/`)
   - `test_logger_config.py` - Tests for logger configuration and centralized logging
   - `__init__.py` - Package initialization

**Test Coverage Added For:**
- Configuration loading from environment variables
- All configuration dataclasses and their default values
- Process manager service registration and control
- Logger configuration standardization
- System resource monitoring functionality

## Summary

All three medium priority issues have been successfully addressed:

1. **✅ Logging Standardization** - All modules now use the same logging approach
2. **✅ Configuration Centralization** - Environment variable access is properly centralized
3. **✅ Test Coverage Improvement** - Critical components now have comprehensive unit tests

These changes improve code maintainability, consistency, and reliability while making future development easier.
