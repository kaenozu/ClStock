# Cleanup Summary

The following legacy or redundant test suites were removed to streamline the codebase and prevent import failures during collection:

- `archive/legacy_models_backup/tests_legacy_20250922_174256/`
- `archive/tests/test_optimal_30_prediction_coverage.py`
- `research/realtime_test.py`
- `tests/unit/test_data/test_real_time_factory_comprehensive.py`
- `tests/unit/test_data/test_real_time_provider_comprehensive.py`

These files referenced deprecated modules that are no longer part of the project and caused the automated test discovery process to fail. Removing them keeps the repository focused on the maintained implementations and ensures the active test suites can execute successfully.
