# ClStock System Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the ClStock system to enhance resource cleanup, error handling, and security.

## 1. Resource Cleanup Improvements

### 1.1 Context Managers
Created new context managers in `utils/context_managers.py`:
- `managed_resource`: General purpose context manager for resources requiring explicit cleanup
- `network_connection`: Context manager specifically for network connections
- `file_lock`: Context manager for file-based locking mechanisms

### 1.2 Graceful Shutdown System
Implemented a comprehensive shutdown management system:
- Signal handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Registration of shutdown handlers for various components
- Automatic cleanup of caches, logs, and network connections
- Proper resource deallocation

### 1.3 Temporary File Management
Created `utils/temp_cleanup.py` for managing temporary files:
- Automatic registration and cleanup of temporary files
- Creation of temporary files/directories with automatic cleanup registration
- Cleanup of old temporary files based on age criteria

### 1.4 Network Connection Management
Implemented `utils/network_manager.py`:
- Managed HTTP sessions with automatic cleanup
- Retry logic for network requests
- Centralized management of active network connections

## 2. Improved Error Handling

### 2.1 Specific Exception Types
Replaced generic exception handling with specific exception types:
- Used existing custom exceptions from `utils/exceptions.py`
- Added more specific exception handling in data fetching and prediction modules
- Improved error messages with more context

### 2.2 Enhanced Cache Error Handling
Improved error handling in `utils/cache.py`:
- Specific handling for pickle errors, IO errors, and key errors
- Better logging of cache operation failures
- Graceful degradation when cache operations fail

### 2.3 Prediction System Error Handling
Enhanced error handling in `models/predictor.py`:
- Specific handling for prediction, model training, and data fetch errors
- Fallback mechanisms when primary prediction methods fail
- Detailed error logging with context

## 3. Enhanced Security

### 3.1 API Security
Implemented security features in `api/security.py`:
- API key authentication using HTTP Bearer tokens
- Rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Role-based access control
- Security headers for all API responses

### 3.2 Authentication
Added API key verification:
- Predefined API keys for development and administration
- Secure token validation
- Proper error responses for invalid credentials

### 3.3 Rate Limiting
Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints:
- Configurable request limits per endpoint
- Client-specific rate limiting based on IP address
- Proper HTTP 429 responses when limits are exceeded

### 3.4 Security Headers
Added security headers to all API responses:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Strict-Transport-Security

## 4. Integration Points

### 4.1 API Endpoints
Updated API endpoints in `api/endpoints.py`:
- Added authentication dependencies to all endpoints
- Implemented rate limiting for each endpoint
- Improved error handling with specific HTTP status codes

### 4.2 Main Applications
Updated main applications to use graceful shutdown:
- `clstock_main.py`: Added shutdown manager integration
- `app/main.py`: Added signal handlers and shutdown integration

### 4.3 Cache System
Integrated cache system with shutdown manager:
- Automatic cache shutdown on application exit
- Proper cleanup of cache files and threads

## 5. Usage Examples

### 5.1 Using Context Managers
```python
from utils.context_managers import managed_resource

def cleanup_function(resource):
    # Cleanup logic here
    pass

with managed_resource(lambda: create_resource(), cleanup_function) as resource:
    # Use resource
    pass
```

### 5.2 API Authentication
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer development-key" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recommendations
```

### 5.3 Rate Limiting
API endpoints now have built-in rate limiting:
- Recommendations: 50 requests per minute
- Single recommendation: 100 requests per minute
- Available stocks: 200 requests per minute
- Stock data: 150 requests per minute

## 6. Configuration

### 6.1 API Keys
API keys are defined in `api/security.py`:
- `development-key`: For development use
- `admin-key`: For administrative access

### 6.2 Rate Limiting Configuration
Rate limits can be configured per endpoint in the decorator:
```python
@rate_limit(max_requests=100, window_seconds=60)
```

## 7. Testing

The improvements have been designed to maintain backward compatibility while enhancing system reliability and security. All existing functionality should continue to work as expected with the added benefits of improved resource management, error handling, and security.
