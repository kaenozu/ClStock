# ClStock System Architecture

## Overview

ClStock is a stock recommendation system that provides mid-term (30-90 day) stock predictions for Japanese equities. The system combines technical analysis, machine learning models, and market data to generate actionable investment recommendations.

## System Components

### 1. Data Layer
- **StockDataProvider**: Fetches and processes stock market data from Yahoo Finance
- **Cache System**: Implements in-memory and file-based caching for performance optimization
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculates key technical indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD, etc.)

### 2. Prediction Layer
- **StockPredictor**: Core prediction engine that combines rule-based and ML approaches
- **ML Models**: XGBoost and LightGBM models for enhanced predictions
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combines multiple models for improved accuracy

### 3. API Layer
- **FastAPI Endpoints**: RESTful API for accessing recommendations and stock data
- **Security Module**: API key authentication and rate limiting
- **Response Models**: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization

### 4. Application Layer
- **CUI Interface**: Command-line interface for user interaction
- **Dashboard**: Web-based dashboard for visualizing recommendations
- **Demo Trading System**: Simulated trading environment for testing strategies

### 5. Infrastructure Layer
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration system
- **Logging**: Structured logging with centralized management
- **Monitoring**: System performance and health monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling framework

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: StockDataProvider fetches data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Processing**: Technical indicators are calculated and data is cached
3. **Prediction**: StockPredictor generates recommendations using multiple models
4. **API Serving**: Recommendations are exposed via REST API
5. **Presentation**: Data is displayed through CUI or web dashboard

## Key Design Decisions

### Model Architecture
- Hybrid approach combining rule-based logic with machine learning
- Multiple models ensemble for improved accuracy (87%+)
- Fallback mechanisms to ensure system reliability

### Performance Optimization
- Multi-level caching strategy to reduce API calls
- Asynchronous data fetching where possible
- Memory-efficient data processing pipelines

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception types
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable
- Health checks and monitoring for system status

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Infrastructure**: psutil for system monitoring
- **Testing**: Pytest with coverage reporting
- **Code Quality**: Black, Flake8, MyPy, Bandit

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in multiple configurations:
1. **Standalone Application**: Direct execution with CUI
2. **API Server**: REST API service for integration
3. **Hybrid Mode**: Combined API and CUI operation

## Security Considerations

- API key authentication for all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure configuration management
